# ‚úÖ **FIXED: Goals Page Not Updating**

## **Problem:**
- Goals page was using `goal.transactions` (empty for manually added transactions)
- Dashboard was fixed but Goals page still used old logic

## **Solution:**
Updated **ALL methods** in `GoalsController.js`:
- ‚úÖ `getGoals()` - Now fetches ALL user transactions
- ‚úÖ `createGoal()` - Uses all transactions for progress calculation
- ‚úÖ `getGoal()` - Uses all transactions for progress calculation  
- ‚úÖ `updateGoal()` - Uses all transactions for progress calculation

## **Test It:**
1. Refresh Goals page at http://localhost:5173
2. You should see: **$25 / $10 spent (250%)** ‚ùå
3. Goal exceeded! 

Both Dashboard AND Goals page now show correct progress! üéâ
