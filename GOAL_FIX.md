# ‚úÖ **FIXED: Goal Progress Not Updating**

## **Problem:**
- Manually added transactions weren't showing up in goal progress
- Dashboard was only using `goal.transactions` (empty for new transactions)

## **Solution:**
1. **DashboardController.js** - Now fetches ALL user transactions, not just goal-linked ones
2. **goalEvaluationService.js** - Fixed date comparison to handle both Date objects and ISO strings

## **Test It:**
1. Refresh your dashboard at http://localhost:5173
2. You should see: **$25 / $10 spent (250%)** ‚ùå
3. Goal exceeded by $15! 

The change should be visible immediately! üéâ
