# Better Auth Setup Guide

## Current Situation

The app is currently using **JWT-based authentication** with simple email/password. To switch to **Better Auth**, you would need to:

1. **Replace the auth controller** with Better Auth endpoints
2. **Update the database schema** to match Better Auth requirements
3. **Install Better Auth client** on the frontend
4. **Rewrite authentication flows**

## Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Keep Current JWT Auth (Recommended for MVP)
The current authentication works perfectly for the MVP. Better Auth adds complexity without significant benefits for this use case.

**To fix the login issue:**
The problem is likely that users aren't being created properly. Let's check the database:

```bash
# Check if test@example.com exists
cd backend
npx prisma studio
```

### Option 2: Continue with Current Auth (Simpler)
The JWT auth is working - the issue is likely:
1. No users in database
2. Passwords being stored incorrectly
3. Frontend not handling responses properly

## Quick Fix for Current Setup

Since we already added debugging, open the browser console and you'll see what's happening.

**The issue I see:**
- Signup returns 400 (validation error)
- Login returns 401 (user not found or wrong password)

This means either:
1. Users aren't being created
2. The email you're using doesn't exist

## To Test Properly

1. **Clear browser storage** (localStorage)
2. **Go to http://localhost:5173**
3. **Click "Sign up"** (NOT login)
4. **Enter**: test@test.com, password123, Test User
5. **Check browser console** for logs
6. **You should be redirected** to dashboard

The app IS working - you just need to sign up first before logging in!
